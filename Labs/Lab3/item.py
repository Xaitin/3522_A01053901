        Right, this here is another way of using properties.
        We use decorators. The @property decorator defines a property
        that only allows us to GET a value and not set one.

        I want to point out that I have not expected you to do this in
        your labs. I'm using this as an opportunity to introduce you to
        a new way of avoiding mechanical getters and setters.
